                                 such as removing toxic content and sanctioning anti-normative behaviors in
                                 user-governed communities. The synchronicity and ephemerality of live-streaming
                                 communities pose unique moderation challenges. Based on interviews with 21 volunteer
                                 moderators on Twitch, we mapped out 13 moderation strategies and presented them in
                                 relation to the bad act, enabling us to categorize from proactive and reactive
                                 perspectives and identify communicative and technical interventions. We found that
                                 the act of moderation involves highly visible and performative activities in the
                                 chat and invisible activities involving coordination and sanction. The juxtaposition of
                                 real-time individual decision-making with collaborative discussions and the dual
                                 nature of visible and invisible activities of moderators provide a unique lens into a
                                 role that relies heavily on both the social and technical. We also discuss how the
                                 affordances of live-streaming contribute
                                 to these unique activities.</p>

                             <p class="card-text">Live streaming is a form of interactive media that potentially makes
                                 streamers more vulnerable to harassment due to unique attributes of the technology
                                 that facilitates enhanced information sharing via video and audio. In this study we
                                 document the harassment experiences of 25 live streamers on Twitch from underrepresented
                                 groups including women and/or LGBTQ streamers, and investigate how they handle and
                                 prevent adversity. In particular, live streaming enables streamers to self-moderate
                                 their communities, so we delve into the methods of how they manage their communities
                                 from both a social and technical perspective. We found that technology can cover the
                                 basics for handling negative but much emotional and relational work is invested in
                                 moderation, community maintenance,and self care</p>

                                 tools, which include auto-moderation tools provided by Twitch, third-party
                                 applications, and home-brew apps. The authors interviewed 21 moderators on
                                 Twitch and categorized the current features of real-time moderation tools they
                                 are using into four functions (chat control, content control, viewer control,
                                 settings control) and explored some new features of tools that they wish to own
                                 (eg, grouping chat by languages, pop out window to hold messages, chat slow
                                 down, a set of buttons with pre-written/pre-message content, viewer activity

                                 ignoring them, or trying to educate them were the most effective strategies.</p>

                                 Fortnite not only offers novel game mechanics but also allows
                                 players to purchase special in-game items using real money.
                                 Based on an online survey of 215 Fortnite players, this paper
                                 investigates in-game behaviors that can be used to explain who
                                 is more likely to spend money in Fortnite. Specifically, players’ motivations
                                 to spend real-life money were categorized;
                                 how the amount of spending was correlated with different
                                 motivations and behavioral factors was also analyzed. In contrast to prior
                                 virtual goods literature that associates in-game
                                 purchasing with social and task motivations, we found that
                                 motivations to make in-game purchases in Fortnite were less
                                 about assimilating with others and more about looking visually unique from others.
                                 We conclude by discussing how the
                                 survival genre of battle royale and other game affordances may
                                 explain these findings.</p>

                                 e-commerce integrated with real-time social interaction via live streams.
                                 Using a uses and gratifications framework, we identified four motivations
                                 (enjoyment of interaction, substitutability of personal examination, need
                                 for community, and trend setting) related to live streaming commerce, and
                                 explored relationships between motivations and behavioral intentions in three
                                 different scenarios: general watching scenario, product search scenario, and
                                 internet celebrity scenario. Results showed that substitutability of personal
                                 examination was associated with the general watching scenario and product search
                                 scenario, while enjoyment of interaction was associated with the internet
                                 celebrity scenario. Trend setting was associated with all scenarios but need
                                 for community was insignificant with all scenarios. Design implications based
                                 on results are discussed for future live streaming commerce system development.</p>

                             <p class="card-text">Watching live streams as part of the online shopping experience is a relatively
                                 new phenomenon. In this paper, we examine live streaming shopping, conceptualizing it as a type
                                 of online shopping that incorporates real-time social interaction. Live streaming shopping can
                                 happen in two ways: live streaming embedded in e-commerce, or e-commerce integrated into live
                                 streaming. Based on prior research related to live streaming and consumer motivation theories,
                                 we examined the relationships between hedonic and utilitarian motivations and shopping intention.
                                 We found that hedonic motivation is positively related to celebrity-based intention and utilitarian
                                 motivation is positively related to product-based intention. A content analysis of open-ended
                                 questions identified eight reasons for why consumers prefer live streaming shopping over regular
                                 online shopping.</p>
