                             <p class="card-text">Modern social media platforms like Twitch, YouTube, etc.,  embody an
                                 open space for content creation and consumption. However, an unintended consequence of
                                 such content democratization is the proliferation of toxicity and abuse that content
                                 creators get subjected to. Commercial and volunteer content moderators play an indispensable
                                 role in identifying bad actors and minimizing the scale and degree of harmful content.
                                 Moderation tasks are often laborious, complex, and even if semi-automated, they involve
                                 high-consequence human decisions that affect the safety and popular perception of the
                                 platforms. In this paper, through an interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers
                                 from social science, human-computer interaction, and visualization, we present a systematic
                                 understanding of how visual analytics can help in human-in-the-loop content moderation.
                                 We contribute a characterization of the data-driven problems and needs for proactive
                                 moderation and present a mapping between the needs and visual analytic tasks through a
                                 task abstraction framework. We discuss how the task abstraction framework can be used
                                 for transparent moderation, design interventions for moderators' well-being, and
                                 ultimately, for creating futuristic human-machine interfaces for data-driven content

                             <p class="card-text">Content moderation is an essential part of online community health and
                                 governance. While much of extant research is centered on what happens to the content,
                                 moderation also involves the management of violators. This study focuses on how moderators
                                 (mods) make decisions about their actions after the violation takes place but before
                                 the sanction by examining how they ``profile'' the violators. Through observations and
                                 interviews with volunteer mods on Twitch, we found that mods engage in a complex process
                                 of collaborative evidence collection and profile violators into different categories to
                                 decide the type and extent of punishment. Mods consider violators' characteristics as
                                 well as behavioral history and violation context before taking moderation action.
                                 The main purpose of the profiling was to avoid excessive punishment and aim to integrate v
                                 iolators more into the community. We discuss the contributions of profiling to moderation
                                 practice and suggest design mechanisms to facilitate mods' profiling processes. </p>

                                 and used NetEase Cloud Music (a popular social music app) as the research platform for
                                 a preliminary exploration of user's motives and their relationship with technology
                                 acceptance and social presence. The interview study (N=21) shows that users preferred
                                 NetEase Cloud Music rather than other services because of five reasons (recommended by
                                 acquaintance, good UI design, accurate recommendation and classification system,
                                 wonderful comments and a sense of community, and user relation activities). The survey
                                 study (N=246) shows that wonderful comment and a sense of community is strongly related
                                 to social presence; good UI design is strongly related to ease of use; accurate
                                 recommendation and classification system is strongly related to usefulness. We discuss

                             <p class="card-text">With the flourish of collaborative and social technologies in the market since the pandemic,
                                 there is limited understanding of user's attitudes towards these technologies. We aim to understand
                                 teleworkers' perceptions of technology use during the pandemic and interviewed 46 teleworkers. We found
                                 that teleworkers generally hold a positive attitude towards social technologies and are creative to use
                                 these technologies to meet their social needs; they express overall negative feelings about remote
                                 collaboration technologies, though online communication flattens the communication hierarchy in the
                                 organization. The pandemic amplifies the extant challenges and highlights the shortcomings of technological
                                 design in well-established teleworking research and remote collaboration work. We suggest that
                                 future design should 1) combine and commercialize solutions that are well-grounded in prior work;
                                 2) consider scenarios that are typically missed and can be easily replaced with collocated interaction
                                 from the pre-pandemic context into the forced teleworking context. </p>

                                 communities like Twitch consist of thousands of micro-communities called channels. We
                                 conducted two studies to understand the micro-community rules. Study one suggests that
                                 Twitch users perceive that both rules transparency and communication frequency matter
                                 to channel vibe and frequency of harassment. Study two finds that the most popular
                                 channels have no channel or chat rules; among these having rules, rules encouraged by
                                 streamers are prominent. We explain why this may happen and how this contributes to

                                 user-governed communities. The synchronicity and ephemerality of live-streaming
                                 communities pose unique moderation challenges. Based on interviews with 21 volunteer
                                 moderators on Twitch, we mapped out 13 moderation strategies and presented them in
                                 relation to the bad act, enabling us to categorize from proactive and reactive
                                 perspectives and identify communicative and technical interventions. We found that
                                 the act of moderation involves highly visible and performative activities in the
                                 chat and invisible activities involving coordination and sanction. The juxtaposition of
                                 real-time individual decision-making with collaborative discussions and the dual
                                 nature of visible and invisible activities of moderators provide a unique lens into a
                                 role that relies heavily on both the social and technical. We also discuss how the
                                 affordances of live-streaming contribute
                                 to these unique activities.</p>

                                 streamers more vulnerable to harassment due to unique attributes of the technology
                                 that facilitates enhanced information sharing via video and audio. In this study we
                                 document the harassment experiences of 25 live streamers on Twitch from underrepresented
                                 groups including women and/or LGBTQ streamers, and investigate how they handle and
                                 prevent adversity. In particular, live streaming enables streamers to self-moderate
                                 their communities, so we delve into the methods of how they manage their communities
                                 from both a social and technical perspective. We found that technology can cover the
                                 basics for handling negative but much emotional and relational work is invested in

                                 players to purchase special in-game items using real money.
                                 Based on an online survey of 215 Fortnite players, this paper
                                 investigates in-game behaviors that can be used to explain who
                                 is more likely to spend money in Fortnite. Specifically, players’ motivations
                                 to spend real-life money were categorized;
                                 how the amount of spending was correlated with different
                                 motivations and behavioral factors was also analyzed. In contrast to prior
                                 virtual goods literature that associates in-game
                                 purchasing with social and task motivations, we found that
                                 motivations to make in-game purchases in Fortnite were less
                                 about assimilating with others and more about looking visually unique from others.
                                 We conclude by discussing how the
                                 survival genre of battle royale and other game affordances may

                                 of online shopping that incorporates real-time social interaction. Live streaming shopping can
                                 happen in two ways: live streaming embedded in e-commerce, or e-commerce integrated into live
                                 streaming. Based on prior research related to live streaming and consumer motivation theories,
                                 we examined the relationships between hedonic and utilitarian motivations and shopping intention.
                                 We found that hedonic motivation is positively related to celebrity-based intention and utilitarian
                                 motivation is positively related to product-based intention. A content analysis of open-ended
                                 questions identified eight reasons for why consumers prefer live streaming shopping over regular
